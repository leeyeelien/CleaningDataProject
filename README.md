To run the analysis, 
1. Download and unzip the dataset into your working directory. Do not modify the names of the folders and files in them.
2. Run all the codes in "run_analysis.R"

The codes will create 2 tidy datasets:
1. tidy_dataset.txt - the complete set of subjects, activities, and all the variables showing mean and standard deviation values
2. tidy_summary.txt - a table with the mean values of all variables by subject and activity.

Each step in "run_analysis.R" are further explained in inline comments.
